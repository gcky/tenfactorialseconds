# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gordon (Again)

I'm a software developer originally from Hong Kong, now based in London for over a decade.

I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, and Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the ways technology shapes our everyday lives. My interests range from consumer tech (especially in the mobile space), to transportation (trains, planes, buses), to everyday design, where function meets form in the things we often take for granted.

This blog is where I share thoughts, discoveries, and ideas around those topics. Iâ€™m also building an app on the side, and I plan to document that journey here, the ups, the downs, and everything in between.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been experimenting with content on YouTube and Instagram too. Itâ€™s early days, but Iâ€™m excited to see where it leads.

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to stick around and subscribe!

Oh, and the name _TenFactorialSeconds_? That's a nod to a quirky mathematical fact: 10! seconds is exactly 6 weeks. There's no profound meaning behind it; I just thought it was an interesting coincidence.
